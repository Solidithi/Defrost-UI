<h3 align="center">DEFROST</h3>

[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER - Add project image here]

This is the source repository for the Defrost, a decentralized platform that
connects blockchain project creators, startups with potential funders, investors
providing a transparent and efficient way to showcase and support innovative
blockchain initiatives.

Defrost offers a comprehensive project management system for blockchain
projects, allowing creators to present their ideas with detailed information,
media assets, and social links while enabling supporters to discover and fund
promising projects through a clean, intuitive interface.

Defrost operates fully on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security for
all transactions and project data. The platform supports multiple parachain
networks, giving project creators flexibility in choosing where to deploy their
projects.

Defrost offer various protocols to help the project deployed thrive and create a
community around the project. One such protocol being a no-lose launchpool that
leverage vAsset LST technology from Bifrost omnichain

## Benefits

  mechanism to fairness earning for all investors.
- **Security and Transparency**: Fully decentralized and on-chain processes
  ensure fairness and reliability.
- **Portfolio Growth**: Access to a diverse range of tokens and increased
  earning opportunities.

### For Project Owners

- **Enhanced Liquidity**: Possibility of integrating a flash loan mechanism
  using the investor liquidity and earn the portion of the profit from the flash
  loan (this feat is a follow up expand of Defrost and haven't implemented)
- **Community Engagement**: Build a loyal base of investors through fair and
  transparent reward systems.
- **Trust Building**: Decentralized systems ensure fair token distribution and
  increased trust.

### For the Parachain Ecosystem

- **Increased Activity**: Encourages greater use of Polkadot and Kusama
  networks.
- **Showcasing PolkaVM**: Demonstrates the capabilities of Polkadotâ€™s virtual
  machine for decentralized applications.
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Attracts more developers and projects to the parachain
  ecosystem, boosting its overall value.

### For the Bifrost Ecosystem

- **vAsset Utility**: Expands the use cases for vAssets, increasing their
  adoption and liquidity.
- **Enhanced Staking Appeal**: Adds value to the Bifrost platform by integrating
  it with other DeFi opportunities.
- **Ecosystem Synergy**: Strengthens the connection between Bifrost and the
  broader Polkadot ecosystem, driving mutual growth.

### Frontend Structure

- **Pages**: App router-based page components (`app/page.tsx`,
  `app/project/create/page.tsx`, etc.)
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements organized by functionality
  (`app/components/`)
- **State Management**: Zustand stores for various domains (`app/store/`)
- **API Integration**: Next.js API routes for server-side operations
  (`app/api/`)
- **Utilities**: Helper functions for common operations (`app/utils/`)

### Key Components

- `app/components/UI/`: Core UI components including buttons, modals, and
  effects
- `app/components/project-detail-sections/`: Components for project display
- `app/components/homepage-sections/`: Landing page sections
- `app/components/layout/`: Layout components like Navbar and Footer
- `app/components/pool-specific-rows/`: Components related to launchpool

### Backend Integration

- Prisma schema for database modeling (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- API routes for data operations (`app/api/`)
- Smart contract ABIs for blockchain interaction (`abi/`)
- Configuration files for blockchain networks (`app/config/chains.json`)

### Smart Contract Integration

Defrost smart contracts defined in the `abi/` directory:

- `ProjectHubUpgradeable.json`: Main contract for project registration and
  management
- `Launchpool.json`: Contract for funding pool operations
- `ERC20.json`: Standard ERC20 token interface implementation

Contract interactions use the Wagmi hooks pattern:

```typescript
// Example contract interaction
const {
	writeContract: createProject,
	status: createProjectStatus,
	data: createProjectHash,
} = useWriteContract();
```

### How interest accrues in our no-loss launchpool

- Exchange Rate System: Rather than directly distributing tokens, the contract
  maintains cumulativeExchangeRate that increases over time according to
  predefined emission rates.

- Block-Based Emission: The contract defines emission rates that change at
  specified blocks through emissionRateChanges and changeBlocks.

- Proportional Distribution: Project tokens are distributed proportionally to
  users based on their staked native amount and the change in the cumulative
  exchange rate since their last interaction.

1. Emission Rate Determination: The contract determines the current emission
   rate based on the block number
2. Pending Exchange Rate Calculation: When \_tick() is called, the contract
   calculates additional exchange rate accrued
3. Interest Accrual: Every time a user stakes, unstakes, or claims tokens, the
   \_tick() function updates cumulativeExchangeRate
4. Claimable Interest Calculation: A user's claimable project tokens are
   calculated using the same mechanic just not saving to state so this is
   essentially causing no gas, maintaining a smooth frontend flow while still
   get the accurate state of the contract without interacting with it
5. Claim Offset Update: After claiming or when staking/unstaking, the offset is
   updated
